The second figure - a Kappa - is a mythological creature reputed for its mischief. In my work, it serves a more humble purpose, acting as a wooden plug for the second pipe. The stone dragon and wooden Kappa transport the viewer straight into the heart of Japanese culture, where mythology intertwines with everyday life."},{"p-title":"The rocks coated in sulfur set the atmosphere, creating a fantastical ambiance inspired by the peculiarities of the volcanic setting of Beppu.

Those pigeons they’re like lively paint splashes, reminding you of where all the art goodness began. The cage, with its minimalistic design, takes you back to the old-school graphic vibes.

That is a loose translation of a quote by Иван Айвазовский, the Russian Romantic painter. Though he is considered one of the greatest masters of marine art, I enjoy his paintings depicting nature a bit further from the coast. In these paintings, you can feel the air, bliss, and lightness of the monumental structures formed by nature. It is the closest thing to why hiking has always been a pleasure of mine. And making something out of it was always in my backlog."},{"p-title":"I hesitated, probably because I am not a painter. But the solution presented itself out of the blue. Robert Simmon of PlanetLabs posted a photo he made with their satellite at A LOW angle. The central element of it is Monte Fitz Roy — a mountain in the Patagonia Region on the border of Argentina and Chile. With an elevation of 3405 m and sheer granite faces, it is one of the most technically challenging mountains to ascent on Earth. Looking at it, one can see that it is a photo indeed, but there is something either with the angle or contrast between highlights and shadows that makes it look fictional, pictorial. It is an ideal mix of Aivazovsky’s ideas and areas where I operate in visual crafts. Also, the grand finale of my month-long trip to Patagonia in 2017 started in Santiago, Chile. Consequently, it occupies a special place in my heart. So, I’ve used a node-based procedural terrain editor to set up a scene with the initial mountain ridge. I drew simple shapes to outline the landscape and added essential displacement to achieve a naturally erratic look. To accomplish a realist appearance, erosion should be applied. This filter simulates the erosion of the terrain by thousands or millions of years of weathering by rain and flowing water. It is a handy tool to add detail and realism to human-created terrain."},{"p-title":"I excluded all areas on a slope more significant than a specific value and applied snow texture to the rest.

Okay, it\u0026#39;s time to recall that this artwork is not just a game or VFX asset for future use. When you fly on a plane over mountains, it is simply impossible not to see patterns and symbols formed by nature. Why not take it even further?

At first glance, the task is easy - choose anything, and it will work, yet if you look at mountains from the top, the shapes they entail are usually quite random. Therefore, I need to go with a simple set of lines that look elegant and have a meaning that works together with mountain scenery. My first guess was pretty straightforward. Let’s proceed with a kanji 天 that has a vocabulary meaning Heaven. Even though it is still one of my favorites in terms of strokes, it doesn’t go well here; too artificial for nature. The same applies to the 北 North character; I tried to use it in my second attempt. Finding such straight mountain ridges—especially the parallel ones- was rare.

And this then means it is possible to say that only the beautiful is functional.\u0026quot; Kenzo is very much into making beautiful and functional things. Like the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Or the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Tokyo. But what took me is the notion that only through beauty function could be conveyed. I frequently hear that function should always prevail and visual and pictural part is less important, especially in the Big Tech field where I work now. So, hearing something opposite (and closer to how I see it) made me think of commemorating this quote. From the start, I wanted typography to be an integral part of this.

The column was bathed in a riveting red light, creating an eerie effect that demanded attention. Separate lighting setups for the background and foreground enhanced the depth of the visual work. Though the artist initially maintained accuracy regarding the Torii gate’s original location, the need for a more dramatic image provoked a pullback from this source. Consequently, the foreground depicted the aftermath of calamity, strewn with remnants of buildings, showcasing the harsh reality of a quake-ridden city scene.

The Art group Rimini project prepared a room with jellyfish and had a narrative telling that almost everything that damages our ecosystem benefits jellyfish. Moreover, this is achieved because jellies are at the top level of their evolutionary state. Millions of years have passed, and they are more or less the same. We frankly can say that they achieved some level of mastery. I mean, evolution mastery."},{"p-title":"A metaphor was chosen, and I started thinking about the visualization. I used a photo I took at the Sumida Aquarium in Tokyo. It has a lot of tanks with jellies with a remarkable light setup. So, it was easy to make a good reference photo, which I used to create a 3D model, and consequently, I applied some sculpting to achieve an organic look. But I didn’t want to recreate a jelly as it was seen in nature. They are mysterious or even alien-like creatures.

Yuuzan was a student of Kansai Mori, a big name in the painting scene from that era. Looking at it, the art is like a blast from the past, but it’s also refreshingly modern in its way.

Several of Dejima’s historical structures remain or have been reconstructed in the area, including various residences, warehouses, walls, and gates. This warehouse is number 3. It looks intriguing.

I hope you are with me as we finally begin the drawing process. Yaki means to heat with fire, and sugi is cypress. The fire should be present, no question about it. What about cypress? Cypress was used to build boats. It is cool to picture a boat that can survive the heat of a fire. Yet, it is beyond the limit of possibilities for a realistic boat that carries human beings.
